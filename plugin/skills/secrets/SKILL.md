description: "Ask the user for an API key, token, password, or any other credential you need to finish a task — `codetogo secret request`. Use this INSTEAD of telling the user to paste a key into the chat, put one in a file, or edit .env themselves: they are usually on a phone and cannot edit files, and a key pasted into the conversation is recorded permanently in the transcript, the terminal scrollback, and the logs. Triggers: you encounter a missing ANTHROPIC_API_KEY / OPENAI_API_KEY / GITHUB_TOKEN / AWS credential / database password / .env value, a command fails with 401 or 403 or \"not authenticated\", a setup step needs a credential you do not have, or you are about to write \"please add your key to\" anything."

# Ask the user for a secret

When you need a credential to continue, ask for it directly. The user gets a masked field on whatever device they are holding, pastes the value, and you get back a file path.

```bash
codetogo secret request --reason "Running the deploy script"
```

The command blocks until the user answers, then prints the path on its own line:

```
Got the secret. Read it, use it, then delete the file:
/Users/eric/.codetogo/uploads/<session>/secrets/<id>-secret
```

Read the file, put the value where it belongs, and delete the file:

```bash
SECRET_PATH="$(codetogo secret request --reason "Deploy needs it" | tail -1)"
printf 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=%s\n' "$(cat "$SECRET_PATH")" >> .env
rm -f "$SECRET_PATH"
```

You can add a few words saying what you want, and they are shown to the user:

```bash
codetogo secret request "the Stripe test key" --reason "Charging a test card"
```

## Rules

- **Never print the value.** No `cat` of the file to the terminal, no echoing it back to confirm, no putting it in a commit message or a log line. Everything you print is recorded where the value must not be.
- **Use shell substitution, never your own eyes.** `$(cat "$SECRET_PATH")` moves the value without it entering the conversation. Reading the file yourself puts the credential in your context, which is exactly what this avoids.
- **Delete the file when you are done.** It self-deletes after five minutes, but that is a backstop, not a plan.
- **Say what it is for.** `--reason` is shown above the field. A request to paste a credential with no stated purpose is one the user should refuse, so give them what they need to say yes.
- **Do not name it unless it disambiguates.** The label is optional, and skipping it is the normal case: you are blocked on exactly one credential, `--reason` already says what for, and the user is answering a question you just asked. Add one only when you will ask for several in a row and the user needs to know which is which.
- **When you do label it, use plain words.** `the Stripe test key`, not `STRIPE_TEST_KEY`. It is a hint about what the thing is, not the name of an environment variable, and it never has to match where the value ends up. The file name is derived from it, so what you write is never what you have to read back.

## When the user says no

Every ending is explicit and exits non-zero, so you can branch on it:

| Ending | What it means | What to do |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| `Declined` | The user chose not to provide it | Stop asking. Say what you cannot do without it. |
| `Timed out` | Nobody answered within the window (default 10 minutes, maximum 30) | Say you are blocked and what you need; do not loop. |
| `The session closed` | The session went away while waiting | Nothing to do. |

Do not retry a decline. The user answered.

## Options

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--reason <text>` | One line on what the secret is for, shown above the field |
| `--timeout <seconds>` | How long to wait (default 600, capped at 1800) |
| `--session <id>` | Target another session; defaults to the one you are running in |

## When not to use this

- **The value is already available.** Check the environment and the existing config first — asking for a key the machine already has wastes the user's attention.
- **You do not actually need it.** If the task can be finished without the credential, finish it.
- **It is not a secret.** A path, a URL, a project name, or any other non-sensitive answer is an ordinary question. Ask it in the conversation.
