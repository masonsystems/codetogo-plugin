Triggers: any \"how do I … with CodeToGo\", \"what does codetogo <command> do\", \"why am I not getting notifications\", \"does CodeToGo support …\", or a request to search/look up the CodeToGo docs.

# CodeToGo docs

Answer CodeToGo usage questions from the published docs, not from memory. The docs are one
HTML page at https://codetogo.app/docs with no search API, so this skill ships a helper that
fetches the live page and turns it into greppable text:

```bash
D="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/docs/scripts/docs.sh"
"$D" index                     # every section with its #anchor
"$D" search <term> [term...]   # case-insensitive grep, terms ORed, with context
"$D" section <anchor>          # one whole section, e.g. `section e2e-encryption`
"$D" all                       # the full page as text (~14 KB)
```

Every call re-fetches the page (it's small), so you always read what's deployed.

## How to answer

1. **Search first, then read the section.** `search` finds the line; `section <anchor>` gives
   the surrounding steps and code blocks you need to answer correctly. Quote commands
   exactly as the docs print them.
2. **Link the section.** Each `## Heading   [#anchor]` maps to
   `https://codetogo.app/docs#<anchor>` — end the answer with that link so the user can
   read more.
3. **Not in the docs? Say so, then use the next source.** `search` prints
   `(no match for: …)` rather than failing. In that case, in order:
   - `codetogo --help` and `codetogo <command> --help` — the installed CLI's own reference,
     which covers commands the page doesn't yet (for example `snooze`, `rename`, `tail`,
     `copy`, `viewers`).
   - The other skills and commands in this plugin: `codetogo:cli` (sessions, ids, triage),
     `/codetogo:spawn`, `/codetogo:schedule`, `/codetogo:copy`, `/codetogo:handoff`,
     `/codetogo:resume`, `/codetogo:compact`.
   - Tell the user it isn't documented. Don't invent a flag or a setting.
4. **Diagnose with the docs' own commands.** For "it isn't working" questions the
   Troubleshooting section names the checks (`codetogo status`, `codetogo hook check`,
   `codetogo repair`, `codetogo logs search`). Run the read-only ones when you're on the
   user's machine and report what they show, instead of listing them for the user to run.

## Hazards

- The page is the **user-facing** manual. It doesn't cover internals; for session ids,
  transcripts, or "what is session X doing", use `codetogo:cli` instead.
- `codetogo stop` appears in the CLI table. Never run it to fix a problem — it kills every
  session on the machine and cuts the user off from their phone. `codetogo restart` keeps
  sessions.
- `curl` must reach codetogo.app. If the fetch fails (offline, sandbox), fall back to
  `codetogo --help` and say the live docs were unreachable.
- Set `CODETOGO_DOCS_URL` to point the helper at a staging or local Worker.
