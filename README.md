# CodeToGo plugin for Claude Code

Companion slash commands for [CodeToGo](https://codetogo.app), the natural-language front
door to the `codetogo` CLI:

- **`codetogo:cli` skill** (no slash command — loads itself when relevant) — teaches an
  agent to work the `codetogo` CLI: list what's running on this machine, map a transcript
  id back to the session that wrote it, read what a session said without attaching, and
  see what's waiting on you.
- **`codetogo:docs` skill** (no slash command — loads itself when relevant) — answers
  "how do I … with CodeToGo" questions from the live documentation at
  [codetogo.app/docs](https://codetogo.app/docs): it fetches the page, searches it, and
  quotes the matching section with a link, falling back to `codetogo --help` for anything
  the page doesn't cover yet.
- **`/codetogo:spawn`** — start fresh, titled sessions *now*, one per task, in any project
  directory — driveable from your phone the moment they start.
- **`/codetogo:schedule`** — schedule a fresh, pre-seeded Claude Code session to fire later
  on your own dev machine.
- **`/codetogo:handoff`** · **`/codetogo:resume`** — write a handoff another agent (or a
  fresh session) can pick up, and resume from one.
- **`/codetogo:compact`** — reset a *live* CodeToGo session's context in place: like
  `/compact`, but a real process reset — hot-swap the `claude` process, reseeded from a fresh
  handoff, without a reconnect.
- **`/codetogo:copy`** — put formatted content on the clipboard of the phone or browser
  viewing the session, so a paste into Gmail/Docs/Slack keeps bold, bullets, tables, and
  monospace.

## Prerequisites

The CodeToGo CLI must be installed and running (the plugin shells out to it):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://codetogo.app/install.sh | bash
codetogo login
codetogo start
```

## Install

In Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add masonsystems/codetogo-plugin
/plugin install codetogo@codetogo-marketplace
```

## Working the CLI (`codetogo:cli` skill)

A skill, not a command — it loads on its own whenever a task involves a session on this
machine, a session id, "which agent wrote this", or a `codetogo` command. It exists to
stop agents burning turns on questions the CLI answers in one call:

```bash
codetogo sessions --json     # every live session: state, title, cwd, and BOTH ids
```

If it doesn't seem to load on its own, invoke it once by hand (`Skill: codetogo:cli`) —
Claude Code budgets the always-on skill listing and ranks it by recent use, so on a machine
with a lot of skills installed a brand-new one can start out ranked too low to be offered.
One use is enough to promote it.

The load-bearing thing it teaches is that each session has **two** unrelated uuids — the
PTY/CodeToGo `id` and the `agentSessionId` naming the Claude/Codex transcript on disk —
that are not interchangeable, and that neither command falls back to the other. With the
mapping in hand, "which session produced this commit?" is a `jq` one-liner over
`agentSessionId` instead of a grep across `~/.claude/projects`. It also covers reading a
session's last messages without attaching to it (`codetogo tail`), triaging what's
`waiting-on-you` / `blocked-on-you`, resolving an id from a *dead* session out of the
resume snapshots, and the read-only-vs-intrusive line (`connect` attaches to a live PTY;
`stop` kills every session on the machine).

## Asking how to use CodeToGo (`codetogo:docs` skill)

A skill, not a command — it loads when you ask a usage question ("how do I pair my phone
for end-to-end encryption?", "why am I not getting push notifications?", "what does
`codetogo spawn` do?"). It answers from the published docs rather than the model's memory:
a bundled helper fetches https://codetogo.app/docs, greps it, and the agent quotes the
matching section and links it (`https://codetogo.app/docs#<section>`). Anything the page
doesn't cover falls back to `codetogo --help` and the plugin's other skills, and the agent
says plainly when something isn't documented instead of guessing. Same ranking caveat as
`codetogo:cli`: invoke it once by hand (`Skill: codetogo:docs`) if it doesn't load on its own.

## Spawn

```
/codetogo:spawn fix the flaky auth test
/codetogo:spawn triage the support inbox in ~/src/support-bot, and bump deps in ~/src/site
```

One fresh `claude "<prompt>"` session per task — titled for the task, started in that
task's own project directory, detached, and live in your CodeToGo session list immediately, so you can watch, approve, and steer each one from
your phone (assuming `codetogo` is connected to the cloud — the CLI warns at spawn time if
it isn't). Reach for it (instead of in-session team agents/subagents) when you'll drive
the new sessions yourself, or the tasks aren't part of the current session's work — e.g.
one planning session fanning work out across several projects. Same ground rules as
schedule: each prompt is written self-contained (the new session has no memory of the chat
that spawned it), and each directory should be a trusted Claude project.

## Schedule

```
/codetogo:schedule review the open PRs every weekday at 9am
/codetogo:schedule list
/codetogo:schedule remove nightly-review
```

A scheduled run is a **fresh** `claude "<prompt>"` in the chosen directory — it inherits
that dir's files/tools/creds but has **no memory** of the chat that created it, so the
prompt is always written to be self-contained. The directory must be a trusted Claude
project (open Claude there once and accept the trust dialog), and `codetogo` must be
running for the schedule to fire.

## Handoff, resume & compact

Transfer context across a boundary — a new agent, a new session, or a fresh process under
the *same* live session:

```
/codetogo:handoff            # write .claude/tmp/HANDOFF.md (add `quick` for the essentials)
/codetogo:resume [path]      # pick up from a handoff (default: .claude/tmp/HANDOFF.md)
/codetogo:compact [path]       # reset THIS live CodeToGo session in place, reseeded from a handoff
```

`handoff` and `resume` are tool-agnostic — the handoff is a plain `HANDOFF.md` any AI coding
agent can read, kept in the gitignored `.claude/tmp/` and treated as a one-shot baton
(`resume` deletes a default handoff the moment it reads it).

`compact` is CodeToGo-native: inside a CodeToGo-owned session (a `codetogo claude` session, the
web "new session" button, or a scheduled run) it writes a handoff and arms an **in-place
process swap**. At the next idle boundary the old `claude` is killed and
`claude /codetogo:resume <path>` takes its place under the same PTY — same session id,
viewers, phone entry, terminal pane, and scrollback. It's `/compact`, but the reset is a real
new process (a true near-zero context reset) and the client sees no reconnect, only new
output. Reach for it when the context is *polluted*, not merely long.

## Copy

```
/codetogo:copy                                   # copy what we just wrote
/codetogo:copy the release notes, as an email
```

The agent runs on your dev machine, but the clipboard it writes is the one on the device
**viewing the session**. The agent writes plain markdown; the CLI converts it to email-ready
HTML (Gmail's Arial 14px, real bullets and tables, monospace for commands), sends it down the
session's own encrypted pipe, and a chip appears over your terminal. One tap on **Copy** puts
it on your clipboard — both a rich and a plain flavor, so a paste into Gmail, Docs, or Slack
keeps the formatting while a paste into a plain editor still reads.

Headings, bold/italic, inline and fenced code, nested bullet and numbered lists, pipe tables
with column alignment, links, and horizontal rules all carry over. Converting in the CLI
rather than the agent is what makes this one turn instead of two.

The tap is required: browsers only allow a clipboard write inside a real user gesture. The
chip waits until you take it, so this works fine when your phone is in your pocket. Nothing
viewing the session means nowhere for the chip to land — open it on your phone or in a
browser first.
